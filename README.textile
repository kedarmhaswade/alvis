h1. Introduction

An algorithm visualisation tool inspired by http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/CountingSort.html. The only difference is this is entirely done on the command line without any sophisticated graphic support. Let's see how well I do :-)

h1. Environment 

Java 1.5+ and Maven 2+.
Just build it and do: java -jar alvis.jar
